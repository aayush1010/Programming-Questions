Programming Question in C++
### Recursion
* Binary Search
* Array is sorted or not
* Number of zeroes in an integer
* Reversing an integer
* Reversing a string
* Given k find the geometric Sum i.e. 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... + 1/(2^k)
* Given two strings check if one is reverse of other
* Write a program to count all the possible paths from top left to
  bottom right of a MXN matrix with the constraints that from each cell you
  can either move only to right or down
* Remove consecutive duplicate from string
*  Runing up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1
   step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. Possible ways can run up to the stairs.
* Given a String print all the subsets. e.g. for input = abc you need to
  print a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, abc using recursion.
* Given an array and a number N, find all subsets which sum up to N. (pairs,
  triplets, etc.)
* Using the phone keypad return all possible words that can be produced
  given input digits. e.g. 23 > â€œad, ae, af, bd, be, bf, cd, ce, cf
